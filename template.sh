This shell script was created for Advent of Code 2024. This script will:
- Pull the daily challenge into a markdown file
- Download the input as .txt
- Create a template python file to read the input file.

To use, retrieve the session cookie and store it the dotenv file. 

Session cookie can be retrieved by following these steps:
1. Going to the input page (of any day)
2. Click F12, go to the network tab, and refresh
3. Right click on the input, and copy the cookie from the request header

This script is fully written by me, no copilot :)
